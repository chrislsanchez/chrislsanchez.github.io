## 👋 About Me

I'm an electronics engineer 🔧 passionate about technology 💡 and a DIY enthusiast 🛠️. I enjoy working with embedded systems 🤖, programming 👨‍💻, and electronics design—implementing new technologies 🚀 and making things work ⚙️.

I've collaborated with interdisciplinary teams on a variety of projects, from creating a wireless data logger system 📡 for a medical investigation in pneumonology 🫁, to building robots for competitions 🤖🏆, designing toys for children with impairments 🧸, and developing communication systems for launchers 🚀📶.

Currently, I'm working on automation systems 🤖—programming PLCs and developing software to control machines 🏭. Sometimes that means writing C# 💻, sometimes working with real-time logic in Structured Text ⏱️, and other times analyzing test data using Python 🐍📊.

I'm pretty programming-language agnostic 🔄. I believe that once you master one, picking up others gets much easier 💪. That said, I have a soft spot for C 💖 and its extended family—C++ and C# (I know, C# isn't exactly close to the silicon 🧠, but you can still build awesome stuff with it 😄).

These repositories are a collection of my work 📂, where I constantly recycle and improve my code 🔁. If you find something messy 😅, it’s either from long ago—or very recent, because I'm always learning 📚✨.

### 🚀 Some of My Projects

- **🍴 Meal Planning App**
  - **Description**: This is an ongoing project about a multiplatform application using .NET technologies. The aim is to create an app that automatically generates a supermarket shopping list without collecting data, allowing users to personalize recipes.
  - **Skills and Technologies**: .NET, C#

- **🤖 Line Follower Robot**
  - **Description**: This was a fun little line-following robot I built with my robotics group during my bachelor's degree. We made it to have some fun and raise some money for other cool electronic projects!
  - **Skills and Technologies**: Electronics Design, Teamwork, Embedded Systems, C, Robotics

- **📡 Wireless Optical Communications**
  - **Description**: This was the theme of my promotion as a PhD candidate. A deep dive into the world of wireless optical communication systems.
  - **Skills and Technologies**: Electronics Design, Communication Systems
