## Electronics Engineer | DIY Enthusiast

### About Me
I'm an electronics engineer passionate about technology and a DIY enthusiast. I enjoy working on embedded systems and electronics design, implementing new technologies, and making things work.

I've collaborated with interdisciplinary teams on various projects, ranging from building robots for competitions to creating toys for impaired children and developing communication systems for launchers.

These repositories serve as a collection of my work, where I constantly recycle and improve my code. I prefer programming in C to be close to silicon, but I'm always open to learning and testing new technologies.
